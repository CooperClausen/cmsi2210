
Adding a directory to the Windows O/S search path
=================================================
1.  Determine the directory in which the program you are adding 'resides'
2.  Open a command window and type the name of the program.  If you DON'T
      get a response saying
         "'blah' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
            operable program or batch file."
      the program is already in the search path.  You're done.

3.  click on the windows "start" button and select the "gear" to get to the
      configuration settings window.  Type "environ" in the search box, then
      click on the "edit the system environment variables" link that pops up.
4.  you'll get a window with a button marked "environment variables" near the
      bottom.  Click that button and another window will open.
5.  in that new window, click on the "path" variable then click the "edit"
      button.  You'll get yet another window with all the search path entries
      listed.
6.  you should click "new" and then in the new box in the window type in the
      file path from step one.  For example, on mine, I typed in the directory
      "C:\Program Files\NASM" to add the 'nasm' assembler program to the path.
7.  click "OK" to close the window, then "OK" to close each of the other
      windows, then close the settings window.
8.  open a NEW cmd prompt and type the name of the program you want to run,
      then press "enter".  If all went well, you should see some prompt from
      the desired program or applicaiont which indicates it is running.

DONE!!!
