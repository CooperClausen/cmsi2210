SEMESTER SCORE SO FAR:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework04 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework05 ~ 100.00% of 10 points = 10.00 points
                                total: 30.00 out of 30.00 = 100.00%
                                which is an A-plus
